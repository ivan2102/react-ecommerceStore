      description:
        "The Rolex Day Date 2 platinum ref. 228206 is characterized by a larger 40mm Oyster case measurement and, of course, the line's signature President bracelet with satin and polished semi-circular links and a hidden Crownclasp. The line's namesake features, the day and date display are also present on the ice blue dial, making this preowned Rolex instantly recognizable. The President Day-Date is always presented in a precious metal finish. However, the platinum ref. 228206 that is presented here today is an exceptional variation of the model as platinum offers a distinct weight and sheen that no other metal finish can match.  It will also add significant value to your watch box. A timepiece similar to the platinum Rolex that is presented here today has been spotted on Hip Hop mogul Jay-Z's wrist, creating even more interest for the ref. 228206 among serious collectors.",
